## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Angel: I think that setting up the boilerplate code and researching the topic in question was really fun. It went smooth and had a lot to share with the team during meetings. Also meetings were very impactful and the team went forward sharing ideas that we believe were doable with our skill.

Patrick: i achieved a clear understanding of the project requirements and scope, including baseline and custom features. The group collaborated effectively, ensuring everyone understood their roles and responsibilities.


### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Angel: Time, we are at different time zones with different situations. So setting a time where we can all be in one meeting was a bit challenging but doable. It helped that we were flexible and were quick to adjust our schedules to get things moving.

Patrick:Same as Angel,  Difficulty in scheduling meetings due to team members being in different time zones, leading to delays in collaboration and balancing individual schedules and commitments while ensuring progress on project tasks.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Angel: I think having TFs that could review our design would be great, as we can quickly adjust it to make the UI friendlier

Patrick:So far so good on my side
