## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

- We were able to create visually appealing wireframes. These wireframes are ideally what we want our app to look like. Of course, it's difficult to code something up from scratch to match wireframes 1:1. However, we're heading into the next milestone motivated and ready to take up these tasks. We also created an ERD that is useful for us to reference when it comes to working on our data. By having everything setup properly, it'll give us a smooth launch as we add features to our app.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

- The wireframes took a long time to do. There was a lot of effort put into them and it was hard to gather all the right materials and resources to create them.
- Team communication and expectations were hard to manage. We had trouble matching one another's expectations and this led to worse team collaboration
  
### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

- We would love to demo and pitch to the TFs to make sure our idea is solid
