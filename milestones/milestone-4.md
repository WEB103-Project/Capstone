## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We got the scraper to work to get data from KBB. Once we acquired our data, we created database scripts to create and populate our database with tables. We inserted data into these tables. This helped us especially with having real, usable data. This setup our backend pretty well. 

We got some features added to our frontend. We can display car cards on our frontend.
